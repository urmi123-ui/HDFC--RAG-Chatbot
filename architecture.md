Architecture
Architecture: Mutual Fund FAQ Assistant

This document describes the system architecture for a facts-only, RAG-based FAQ assistant scoped to twelve HDFC Mutual Fund scheme pages on Groww. It is derived from problemStatement.md. The chatbot must retrieve and reply with fund management data (including manager names, tenure, and experience) in addition to other factual fields.


1. Design Goals

Goal

Architectural implication

Facts-only answers

Retrieval grounded in corpus; LLM constrained by system prompt and post-generation validation

Source-backed responses

Every answer carries exactly one citation URL from the active corpus

Compliance

Advisory/comparison queries are classified and refused before or instead of retrieval

Accuracy over intelligence

Prefer retrieved text over model inference; narrow corpus (5 URLs) reduces hallucination risk

Transparency

Fixed response format: ≤3 sentences + citation + Last updated from sources: <date> footer

Privacy

Stateless chat; no PII collection or persistence

Index path (offline): A daily scheduler triggers the ingestion pipeline → fetch 5 Groww pages → parse into structured sections → chunk → embed → persist to vector store and metadata index.


3. System Components

3.1 Presentation Layer (Minimal UI)

A lightweight single-page chat interface inspired by Groww's mutual fund detail pages as reference context.

Responsibilities:

Display welcome message and disclaimer: "Facts-only. No investment advice."
Show three clickable example questions (covering scheme facts and fund management)
Accept free-text user queries
Render assistant replies with citation link and last-updated footer
Never prompt for or accept PII (PAN, Aadhaar, account numbers, OTP, email, phone)
Suggested example questions:

What is the expense ratio of HDFC Mid Cap Fund Direct Growth?
What is the exit load on HDFC Defence Fund Direct Growth?
Who manages HDFC Gold ETF Fund of Fund Direct Plan Growth?

3.2 Application Layer

Chat Controller

Exposes a single endpoint, e.g. POST /api/chat
Accepts { "message": string } only — no session identifiers tied to identity
Routes to classifier, then RAG or refusal path
Returns structured JSON for the UI to render
{

  "answer": "The expense ratio of HDFC Mid Cap Fund Direct Growth is 0.73%.",

  "citation_url": "https://groww.in/mutual-funds/hdfc-mid-cap-fund-direct-growth",

  "last_updated": "2026-05-29",

  "is_refusal": false

}


Query Classifier

Runs before retrieval to enforce compliance.

Class

Examples

Action

Factual

Expense ratio, exit load, min SIP, benchmark, fund manager name/tenure/experience

Proceed to RAG

Advisory

"Should I invest?", "Is this a good fund?"

Refusal handler

Comparison

"Which fund is better?", "Mid cap vs large cap?"

Refusal handler

Performance-seeking

"What returns will I get?", "Compare 3Y returns"

Refusal or link-only response to scheme page

Out of scope

Schemes not in corpus, unrelated topics

Polite refusal with scope explanation

Implementation options (in order of simplicity):

Rule-based keyword/pattern matcher for advisory and comparison phrases
Lightweight LLM classification with a fixed label set
Hybrid: rules first, LLM fallback for ambiguous cases
Refusal Handler

Produces a polite, templated response when classification blocks RAG:

States the facts-only limitation
Does not retrieve or invent fund data
Includes one educational link (AMFI or SEBI), e.g.:
AMFI — Mutual Funds
SEBI — Investor Education
RAG Orchestrator

Coordinates retrieval, prompt assembly, generation, and validation for factual queries.

Response Formatter

Enforces output contract:

Maximum 3 sentences in the answer body
Exactly one citation_url (must match one of the 5 corpus URLs when answering from corpus)
Footer: Last updated from sources: <date> where <date> comes from chunk metadata (page fetch or parse timestamp), not model inference

https://groww.in/mutual-funds/hdfc-defence-fund-direct-growth

Scheme Metadata Index

A small lookup table (JSON or embedded DB) keyed by scheme name / slug:

{

  "slug": "hdfc-mid-cap-fund-direct-growth",

  "scheme_name": "HDFC Mid Cap Fund Direct Growth",

  "category": "Equity — Mid Cap",

  "source_url": "https://groww.in/mutual-funds/hdfc-mid-cap-fund-direct-growth",

  "last_fetched_at": "2026-05-29"

}


Used to:

Resolve which scheme the user is asking about
Pre-filter retrieval to a single scheme when detected
Attach the correct citation URL
Vector Store

Stores embedded text chunks with rich metadata:

Metadata field

Purpose

source_url

Citation link

scheme_name

Scheme disambiguation

section

e.g. expense_ratio, exit_load, fund_management, benchmark

last_updated

Footer date

chunk_text

Raw passage for grounding

Recommended stores for a lightweight build: Chroma, FAISS, or LanceDB (local, file-backed).

Retriever

Two-stage retrieval for better precision on a small corpus:

Scheme resolution — Match user query to one of twelve schemes via slug, name, or alias (e.g. "mid cap", "defence fund")
Semantic search — Top-k chunks (k=3–5) filtered by source_url or scheme_name, optionally boosted by section if query intent is detected (e.g. "fund manager" → boost fund_management)
Because the corpus is tiny (~12 pages), a hybrid approach is viable: metadata filter first, then vector similarity within that subset.


3.4 Generation Layer

LLM (Constrained Generation)

The model receives:

System prompt: facts-only, no advice, use only provided context, max 3 sentences
Retrieved chunks with source URLs and dates
User question
Hard rules in the prompt:

Answer only from retrieved context; if context is insufficient, say so and point to the scheme page
Do not compare funds or compute returns
Do not recommend buy/sell/hold
Include no more than one URL in the answer (formatter may extract citation separately)
Output Validator

Post-generation checks before returning to the user:

Check

Failure action

Answer ≤ 3 sentences

Truncate or regenerate

Citation URL in allowlist

Replace with best matching corpus URL from retrieved chunks

No advisory language detected

Route to refusal template

Grounding: key facts appear in retrieved chunks

Regenerate or fallback to link-only response

Performance numbers not quoted (unless user asked for link)

Strip or refuse


3.5 Offline Ingestion Pipeline

Triggered once per day by the scheduler (see §3.6), or on manual CLI trigger — never on every user query.

Daily Scheduler

Fetch 5 Groww URLs

Parse HTML / Markdown

Extract Sections

Chunk Text

Generate Embeddings

Upsert Vector Store

Update Metadata Index

Ingestion steps

Fetch — HTTP GET each corpus URL; store raw HTML or converted markdown with fetch timestamp
Clean & parse — Remove navigation, footers, and duplicate chrome; retain scheme-specific sections
Section extraction — Map content into logical blocks aligned with FAQ query types:
Section tag

Example content

overview

Category, risk label, AUM, NAV date

expense_ratio

Expense ratio value and definition

exit_load

Load structure and effective dates

minimum_investment

Min SIP, first/second investment

benchmark

Benchmark index name

tax

STCG/LTCG implications (factual only)

fund_management

Manager name, tenure, education, experience, other schemes

investment_objective

Stated objective from scheme description

fund_house

AMC name, website, incorporation date

Chunking — Section-aware chunks (~200–400 tokens) with overlap only within the same section; keep fund manager bios intact in fund_management chunks
Embed — Use a consistent embedding model (e.g. text-embedding-3-small, nomic-embed-text, or equivalent open-source model)
Index — Upsert into vector store; refresh last_fetched_at in metadata index

3.6 Daily Ingestion Scheduler

A dedicated scheduler component runs the full ingestion pipeline on a fixed daily cadence so the vector store and metadata index stay aligned with the latest Groww scheme pages.

Responsibilities:

Trigger ingestion at a configured time each day (e.g. 02:00 UTC / off-peak hours)
Invoke the ingestion entrypoint (ingestion/run.py or equivalent) as a single atomic job
Log start time, completion status, URLs fetched, and chunk count
On failure, record error details and optionally retry once before alerting
Implementation options:

Option

Use case

Cron (Linux/macOS crontab or container cron)

Simple VM / bare-metal deployment

APScheduler (embedded in a worker process)

Single-process Python deployment

GitHub Actions scheduled workflow

Repo-hosted corpus refresh with no dedicated worker

Cloud scheduler (AWS EventBridge, GCP Cloud Scheduler)

Managed production environments

Scheduler flow:

RAG Pipeline

No processing

Refusal

Stateless API — No user accounts, chat history persistence, or analytics tied to identity (optional ephemeral in-memory UI history is acceptable)
Input sanitization — Reject or strip patterns resembling PII before LLM call
Allowlist citations — Validator ensures answer citations are corpus URLs (or fixed AMFI/SEBI URLs for refusals)
No training on user data — Queries are not used to fine-tune models in this phase
Rate limiting — Basic per-IP limits to prevent abuse and cost overrun

9. Deployment Topology

Development (local):

[Browser] → [FastAPI :8000] → [Chroma (local disk)] → [LLM API]

                ↑

         [Daily Scheduler] → [Ingestion script (CLI)]


Production (minimal):

[Browser] → [Static UI (CDN/Vercel)] → [API (container/VM)] → [Vector DB volume]

                                              ↓

                                        [LLM provider]


[Daily Scheduler (cron / cloud scheduler / GitHub Actions)]

        ↓

[Ingestion worker] → rebuild index → Vector DB volume


Corpus refresh: A scheduler triggers the ingestion pipeline once daily, rebuilding the vector store and metadata index from live Groww URLs
Manual re-run remains available via CLI for ad-hoc refreshes outside the schedule
Environment separation: dev uses cached markdown snapshots; prod refreshes from live Groww URLs

10. Non-Functional Requirements

Attribute

Target

Latency (p95)

< 5 s end-to-end (including LLM)

Availability

Best-effort for demo; no SLA in phase 1

Corpus size

Fixed 5 URLs; ~50–150 chunks total

Ingestion cadence

Daily scheduler trigger (automatic corpus refresh)

Answer length

≤ 3 sentences + 1 link + footer

Observability

Log query class, scheme resolved, retrieval scores, refusal rate (no PII)


11. Known Limitations

Corpus scope — Only twelve HDFC schemes on Groww; no AMFI/SEBI document ingestion in this phase
Source freshness — Answers reflect the last successful daily ingestion run; intra-day Groww updates are picked up on the next scheduled run
Third-party source — Groww is used as reference context, not HDFC AMC primary documents (KIM/SID/factsheets)
No performance analytics — Return comparisons and projections are explicitly out of scope
Scheme disambiguation — Ambiguous queries (e.g. "HDFC fund expense ratio" without naming the scheme) may require clarification or return the most similar scheme
Fund management completeness — Manager data is limited to what appears on each Groww scheme page
Document download guides — Not in current corpus unless added to a future URL list

12. Future Extensions (Out of Current Scope)

Expand corpus to 15–25 official AMC / AMFI / SEBI URLs
Add clarification turn: "Which scheme did you mean?"
Structured extraction cache (JSON facts per scheme) for numeric fields like expense ratio
Multilingual support (Hindi)
Admin dashboard for ingestion status and chunk inspection

14. Summary

The Mutual Fund FAQ Assistant is a small-corpus, compliance-first RAG system. A query classifier gates advisory and comparison questions before retrieval. Factual questions flow through scheme-aware retrieval over five indexed Groww pages, grounded LLM generation, and a strict response formatter that enforces brevity, a single citation, and a last-updated footer. A daily scheduler triggers the offline ingestion pipeline to keep embeddings and metadata in sync with the defined corpus. The architecture prioritizes verifiability and refusal correctness over open-ended conversational ability.
